🌍 Problem Statement
Water pollution is a growing concern globally. Monitoring water quality in real-time and predicting pollutant levels can significantly help authorities prevent ecological damage and protect public health.

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict multiple water quality parameters simultaneously, based on historical water quality datasets.

📂 Dataset Description
The dataset includes readings of various physicochemical properties from water bodies. Some of the key features include:

Temperature

pH

Turbidity

Conductivity

Dissolved Oxygen (DO)

And more...

The target variables (multi-output regression) are:

NH₄ (Ammonium)

BOD₅ (Biological Oxygen Demand)

Colloids

O₂ (Oxygen)

NO₃ (Nitrate)

NO₂ (Nitrite)

SO₄ (Sulfate)

PO₄ (Phosphate)

Cl (Chloride)

🧪 Methodology
Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values

Normalized/standardized numerical features

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Model Building

Used MultiOutputRegressor wrapper to support multi-target regression

Base model: RandomForestRegressor (robust to overfitting and works well with tabular data)

Model Evaluation

Evaluated each predicted parameter individually using:

R² Score

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

📈 Visualizations
Correlation heatmaps for understanding feature relationships

Feature importance plots

Actual vs Predicted plots for each target variable

Error distribution histograms
