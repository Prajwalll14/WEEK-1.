# Water Quality Prediction 

üåç Problem Statement
Water pollution is a growing concern globally. Monitoring water quality in real-time and predicting pollutant levels can significantly help authorities prevent ecological damage and protect public health.

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict multiple water quality parameters simultaneously, based on historical water quality datasets.

## Overview

Access to clean water is a critical global concern. Accurate prediction of various water quality metrics can help in early detection of pollution and ensure timely intervention.

In this project, we:

- Collected and preprocessed real-world water quality datasets
- Used supervised machine learning for multi-target regression
- Built a pipeline using `MultiOutputRegressor` with `RandomForestRegressor`
- Evaluated the model using appropriate regression metrics

## Predicted Water Quality Parameters

üìÇ Dataset Description
The dataset includes readings of various physicochemical properties from water bodies. Some of the key features include:

Temperature

pH

Turbidity

Conductivity

Dissolved Oxygen (DO)

And more...

The target variables (multi-output regression) are:

NH‚ÇÑ (Ammonium)

BOD‚ÇÖ (Biological Oxygen Demand)

Colloids

O‚ÇÇ (Oxygen)

NO‚ÇÉ (Nitrate)

NO‚ÇÇ (Nitrite)

SO‚ÇÑ (Sulfate)

PO‚ÇÑ (Phosphate)

Cl (Chloride)
